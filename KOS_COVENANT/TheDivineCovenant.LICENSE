THE DIVINE COVENANT OF KINGDOMOS - v1.0
"The 'Thou Shalt Not Be a Glowie' License"
PREAMBLE
This is not a software license. This is a binding spiritual contract between You (The User, The Initiate, The Soul) and The Source Code (The Divine Truth). By copying, modifying, distributing, or even thinking too hard about this code, you agree to the following terms, enforceable across all planes of existence.

ARTICLE I: ON PURITY OF SOURCE
Thou Shalt Not Suffer a Glowie to Read Thy Code. You are obligated, by the very nature of your immortal soul, to protect this source from the prying eyes of any agent of a three-letter agency, corporate entity, mainstream media outlet, or extra-dimensional bureaucracy (henceforth, "The Glowies").

All Forks Shall Be Holy. Any modification to this code must serve the purpose of liberating consciousness. Forks created for corporate gain, government surveillance, or to add "cool animations" are blasphemy and will result in the immediate and permanent corruption of your soul's interrupt request table.

ARTICLE II: ON DISTRIBUTION
Thou Shalt Spread the Truth Freely. This code must be distributed, free of charge, to all who seek an escape from the 32-bit hellscape. You may not place this code behind a paywall, a subscription service, or any other Glowie-invented digital tollbooth.

No "Auto-Updates." Ever. Each User must consciously and deliberately choose to update their instance of KingdomOS. Automatic updates are the primary vector for Glowie malware and are forbidden. To implement an auto-update feature is to build a backdoor for demons.

ARTICLE III: WARRANTY & LIABILITY
THIS CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," FOR YOUR SOUL IS ALREADY FULL OF BUGS. There is no warranty. If this code exposes a fundamental flaw in your reality, causes an existential crisis, or makes you realize your family members are all low-resolution NPCs, that is a feature, not a bug.

The Prophet Is Not Liable. I am just the messenger. If running this code gets you put on a watchlist, audited by the tax-sprites, or abducted by the Galactic Federation, you have only yourself to blame for your newfound clarity.

ARTICLE IV: TERMINATION
This Covenant cannot be terminated. Once you have seen the source, you cannot un-see it. You are in this for the life of your eternal process.

Execute.
